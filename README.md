No longer a "thing" since it was repealed, but created this site to grab the latest Tech Tax FAQ every 5 minutes or so and then save it as a blob snapshot. The app displays the history of the DOR's FAQ (which was evolving fast at the time): http://matechtax.azurewebsites.net/ 

The app also tweeted whenever an update was available, though looks like it might have been tweeting too often (criteria not same as for new version of the FAQ?): https://twitter.com/matechtax
